# RubyOnRails_CMS_Demo
A simple, homemade Content Management System using Ruby on Rails (Ruby 2.6.3 / Rails 6.1.4)

This CMS can do more than just render paragraphs! It features:

* A Rich Text Editor, via [ActionText](https://rubygems.org/gems/actiontext/versions/6.0.0.rc1)
* Image uploads with resizing and validation for size constraints, via [Carrierwave](https://rubygems.org/gems/carrierwave/versions/0.11.2)
* A Carousel for Images, via [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/carousel/)
* The ability to add Post Content, Pull Quotes, Image Lists, and Images, all from one screen, via [Cocoon](https://rubygems.org/gems/cocoon)
